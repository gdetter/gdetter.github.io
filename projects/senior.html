							<p><b>The Problem:</b></p>
							<p>For those recovering from or at risk of cancer, heart or other diseases, a stent can be the difference between life and death. Stents can be expanded into a blocked passage to resume normal blood, air, or other flow. Aerotech is a company that supplies stent manufacturers with the machines they need to manufacture the stents. Currently, during the laser ablation process, the stent is manually loaded and unloaded from the mandrel. This is a time consuming process that can introduce errors in manufacturing. Aerotech would prefer to supply an all in one solution that does not require a human operator.
							<p><b>The Solution:</b></p>
							<p>Our team developed an automated work cell designed to handle one size of stent. The central piece of the workcell consisted of a hobby grade robotic arm. The arm we selected was the Lynxmotion LSS 4 DoF arm. The primary design aspects of the project included developing the infeed, outfeed, and gripper as well as the code required to control the arm. Four gripper prototypes were developed and tested. They were an inflatable gripper, a three wire gripper, a three prong gripper, and a compliant gripper. We decided to ultimately go with the compliant gripper for its simplicity. An infeed mechanism was developed that could feed one stent at a time to the arm from the same location. A 3D printable version of the current mandrel in use was designed and printed. An outfeed mechanism was also designed so the stents could be dropped into a bin. A video of the entire process is shown below.</p>
