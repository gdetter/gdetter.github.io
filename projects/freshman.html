							<h2>Synchronized Swimming Robots</h2>
							<p><b>The Problem:</b></p>
							<p>For my Art of Making class we were tasked with making our RedBots perform a synchronized dance. We were awarded extra credit if they performed a synchronized swimming routine instead.</p>
							<p><b>The Solution:</b></p>
							<p>While most teams added balloons or other forms of flotation to their robots, me and my teammate realized that the volume of the robot was enough to make it float if we could seal the outside. Using craft foam and hot glue, we managed to waterproof and seal the robots leaving a magnetic flap on the top to access the electronics. We also removed the tires from the wheels and glued on acrylic paddles. A pool was not provided so we had to make our own out of PVC pipe and a tarp that we filled from the chemical wash shower. We then spent a long time coding a synchronized routine to a song that we had to transcribe into code. Our song of choice was Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley. You can see the results of our work int the video below.</p>

							<p><b>My Contribution:</b></p>
							<p>The work on this project was split very evenly between me and my teammate. We both worked on the design, construction, and code.</p>
							<h2>Package Protector</h2>
							<p><b>The Problem:</b></p>
							<p>Every year, there are over 23 million package thefts. There are very few easy to use and simple deterrents in existence. Our goal was to solve this problem without large ugly lock boxes and that would work for any size package.</p>
							<p><b>The Solution:</b></p>
							<p>We developed a device that we called the Package Protector. The electronics were created using littleBits. The Package Protector works by texting the owner of the device "You have received a package" when a package is placed on the pressure sensor. Once the user is ready to pick up the package, they simply respond by texting #itsme. After removing the package texting #gotit rearms the system. If the pressure sensor is released without receiving the text, an alarm sounds and the owner is notified that their package may have been stolen. A dramatic video of the function of the device can be seen below.</p>

							<p>I mainly wokred on the electronics and the physical construction of this project. I also played the thief in the demonstration video.</p>
