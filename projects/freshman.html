							<h2>Synchronized Swimming Robots</h2>
							<p><b>The Problem:</b></p>
							<p>For my Art of Making class we were tasked with making our RedBots perform a synchronized dance. We were awarded extra credit if they performed a synchronized swimming routine instead.</p>
							<p><b>The Solution:</b></p>
							<p>While most teams added balloons or other forms of flotation to their robots, me and my teammate realized that the volume of the robot was enough to make it float if we could seal the outside. Using craft foam and hot glue, we managed to waterproof and seal the robots leaving a magnetic flap on the top to access the electronics. We also removed the tires from the wheels and glued on acrylic paddles. A pool was not provided so we had to make our own out of PVC pipe and a tarp that we filled from the chemical wash shower. We then spent a long time coding a synchronized routine to a song that we had to transcribe into code. Our song of choice was Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley. You can see the results of our work int the video below.</p>

							<p><b>My Contribution:</b></p>
							<p>The work on this project was split very evenly between me and my teammate. We both worked on the design, construction, and code.</p>
							<h2>Package Protector</h2>
							<p><b>The Problem:</b></p>
							<p>Every year, there are over 23 million package thefts. There are very few easy to use and simple deterrents in existence. Our goal was to solve this problem without large ugly lock boxes and that would work for any size package. This was another Art of Making Project.</p>
							<p><b>The Solution:</b></p>
							<p>We developed a device that we called the Package Protector. The electronics were created using littleBits. The Package Protector works by texting the owner of the device "You have received a package" when a package is placed on the pressure sensor. Once the user is ready to pick up the package, they simply respond by texting #itsme. After removing the package texting #gotit rearms the system. If the pressure sensor is released without receiving the text, an alarm sounds and the owner is notified that their package may have been stolen. A dramatic video of the function of the device can be seen below.</p>

							<p><b>My Contribution:</b></p>
							<p>I mainly wokred on the electronics and the physical construction of this project. I also played the thief in the demonstration video.</p>
							<h2>Wearable Distance Tracker</h2>
							<p><b>The Problem:</b></p>
							<p>Running shoes should only be worn for a certian distance before they should be replaced. It can be hard to track the distance they have been worn. My team attempted to solve this as another Art of Making project.</p>
							<p><b>The Solution:</b></p>
							<p>We incorporated a wearable circuit into a pair of Adidas sneakers. An Adafruit Flora GPS receiver was sewn onto the toe of the shoe, LEDs were added to the Adidas logo, and a battery was stored in an attached pocket. An Adafruit Flora arduino was used as the brains of the shoe. Thin gauge silicone wire was sewn into the shoe to connect the components. The Arduino would log everytime your displacement increased by more than five or ten feet. This effecitvely filtered out noise from localized GPS drift. These displacements were added to calculate the total distance. As your distance got closer to the specified value, the LEDs faded from green to red. This behavior can be seen in the video below.</p>

							<p><b>My Contribution:</b></p>
							<p>I worked on the brainstorming, design, and assisted with the code for this project. I was also the model in the video.</p>
							<h2>The Ultimate Crutch Kit (TUCK)</h2>
							<p><b>The Problem:</b></p>
							<p>Crutches are a tool that many people will unfortunately have to use at some point in their lives. Even though they are immensley helpful, they are uncomfortable and incovenient to carry around.</p>
							<p><b>The Solution:</b></p>
							<p>For my final Art of Making project, my team and I developed a cruch acessory kit. The kit included under arm pads, a suction cup to hold up the crutches when not in use, a pocket, and my personal favorite accessory, shoulder straps. The shoulder straps allow you to let go of the crutches when opening doors or holing onto handrails without them falling down. We shared our design at the senior design exo. Our video can be found below.</p>

							<p><b>My Contribution:</b></p>
							<p>I helped design, 3D print, mold, and cast the clips that we used to attach the majority of the accessories that we developed. By casting the clips instead of 3D printing them, we significantly cut down on manufacturing time. I also assisted with the testing and collecting user feedback.</p>
							<h2>Nerf Gun</h2>
							<p><b>The Problem:</b></p>
							<p>I was part of the Urban Gaming Club where we would play humans versus zombies which is a weeklong campus wide game of tag with Nerf Guns. Stock Nerf guns don't have enough power.</p>
							<p><b>The Solution:</b></p>
							<p>I purchased better flywheels (the wheels that spin to shoot the dart), much more powerful motors, some motor controllers, and an Arduino nano. I gutted the original nerf gun and added the new components along with some 3D printed parts to accomodate then. I also added a toggle switch to lower the speed of the motors to avoid injury at closer ranges. I then coded the logic for the Nerf gun, added a lipo drone battery and a voltmeter to monitor the battery.</p>
							<p><b>My Contribution:</b></p>
							<p>I did basically all the work for this project except for the design of the new flywheel cage and the new battery cover which were available online for free.</p>
